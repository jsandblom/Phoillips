# Phoillips

Phoillips is a spoof of a Phillips physiological monitor.  It is intended to be used in medical training situations.

Initially it will only be able to generate a numeric value for pulse and sat, which can be controlled remotely, and used on two machines without logging in.

The two (or more?) machines will be in sync, meaning either one could be used for display

## TODO

Several features are planned including:

1. graph of ECG
2. graph of sats
3. facilities for cuncurrent use
